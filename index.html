          <div class="txt">In a dramatic twist, Laertes, once a trusted noble,
             is now facing trial for his involvement in the recent scandal.
              The courtroom is filled with tension as the accused stands before the royal judges
              , with his fate hanging in the balance. As the kingdom watches closely, 
              the trial is set to determine whether 
              Laertes will regain his honor—or be forever marked by his actions.
